First we have a simple main page to let the user log-in or register. For the login, register page. I used a form to let the user enter his information and JavaScript to validate that each field is filled in and in the right format. If it's not, a pop-up message will appear indicating the mistake he made and when the user enters everything correctly then a success pop-message will appear and redirect it to the home page.



For Farrah's personalized schedule page, we also used a form in HTML to let the user answer some questions which will help us generate a good schedule that matches his preferences for his trip and also, here, we have JavaScript to validate that each field is filled in whenever the user achieves the last question and click on generate schedule button it will redirect him to Myschedules page.
